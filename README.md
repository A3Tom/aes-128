# AES-128: Ma Implementations

This repo is a homage to the incredible minds of [Joan Daemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Daemen), [Vincent Rijmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Rijmen), [Ã‰variste Galois (what a legend)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois),  and all the other giants these geniuses perched on the shoulders of.  

The specific implementation found in this repo is the AES modified varient of Rijndael's algorithm using a fixed block size of 128 bits and 10 rounds with a 128 bit key. 
I might tackle adding the flexability of Rijndael's variable block size at some point but I barely have double digit neurons as it is and they've been workin overtime to get the repo this far.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Self Imposed Constraints**
> 1. Absolutely **zero** code in this repo can be written by anythin that isny ma own 10 wee sausages. Nae AI, Nae copy & paste; just gid auld rawdoggin the keys.
> 2. Any sources used must be linked in the [Aknowledgements and Resources](#acknowledgements-and-resources) section
